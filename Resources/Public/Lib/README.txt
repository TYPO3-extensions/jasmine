We use the Jasmine library for testing, but to support running tests from CLI, and even integration with
hudson or jenkins, we also add the console-reporter / junit-reporter from jasmine-reporters on github. Both
sources are added to the Lib folder, including a README.txt with the corresponding downloadpage.
